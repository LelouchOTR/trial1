### PROJECT RESEARCH
The goal of the project research is to create an overview of the DWH projects available in the market, offered as open-source or low-budget projects.
* Research on available open-source or low-budget DWH projects.
* Identifying suitable projects from various sources: the internet, communities, specialized forums, open-source directories, open-source platforms, and blogs.
* Reviews and user testimonials to gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each respective DWH
* Make a list of available projects and their respective software features.





### FEATURE-SELECTION
The feature selection process aims to address two tasks: (A) Defining the requirements and functionality from the perspective of the medical institution, and (B) Listing the features provided by the projects. After a comparison, three projects will be selected that meet both criteria.


(A) DEFINITION OF REQUIREMENTS AND FUNCTIONALITY
* Open Source- or Low-Budget Project
* Local installation on a web server (LAMP)
* Usability & User Experience
  * Aligning software requirements with the capabilities of users (medical professionals)
  * Define user roles for data retrieval (user) and data import (admin)
  * Information about the data to be stored (text, numbers, images)
* Compatibility and interoperability with existing data
* Verification of the scalability and extensibility of the DWH (capacity limits with growing data volume?)


(B) LISTING OF SOFTWARE FEATURES
* Listing of identified projects and comparison of their respective features
* Assessment of the features of each project and comparison with the requirements of users and the medical institution
* Exampels for features in DWH-Projects:
  * Existing documentation for the DWH covering installation, configuration, and usage
  * Review of the project community: An active community can be an indicator of the quality and longevity of the project
  * Availability of support for questions, issues, or assistance
* The license of the project must align with the planned deployment
