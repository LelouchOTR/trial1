## SOFTWARE INSTALLATION

### Update

##### Due to usability considerations later on (costs), there is a switch to Opensearch. The handling is very similar to Elasticsearch.



The installation on a local or virtual server aims to gain practical experience in both frontend and backend areas. This includes installation, database setup, configuration adjustments, and setting up user accounts (list not exhaustive). This aspect will be implemented with the three previously selected software projects.
  - Project 1: Clickhouse
  - Project 2: Snowflake
  - Project 3: Elasticsearch
  - Project 4: Opensearch
