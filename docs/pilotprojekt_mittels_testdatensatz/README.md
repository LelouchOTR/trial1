## PILOT PROJECT USING TEST DATASET

To test the functionality and user-friendliness of the DWH in a real environment and gather experiences, a suitable test dataset will be imported. The test data consists of two datasets: a base dataset, comprising an (anonymized) cohort of stem cell-transplanted patients, and a dataset containing the corresponding laboratory parameters. As part of the evaluation, the process of importing and selectively exporting a subgroup will be assessed.
* Creation of a two-part test dataset
  * Base dataset of stem cell-transplanted patients
  * Enrichment with laboratory data using a primary key (ID number)
* Test battery to assess the features, user-friendliness, and performance of DWH_hematology
* Assessment of the results and discussion of potential improvements to the DWH as a core element of the project work (documentation in GitHub)
* Review of integration possibilities (existing interfaces) to assess whether the selected DWH can be integrated with other systems and technologies (electronic health records, laboratory information systems)
* Training a medical colleague on the use of the Data Warehouse (DWH) and evaluating the extent to which the system is suitable for the existing (medical) digital ecosystem of the Medizinischen Hochschule Hannover (MHH)
