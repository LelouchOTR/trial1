# DataBase

## Definition
A database, also known as a database system, is essentially an electronic system designed to efficiently manage data. Its main task is to store large amounts of data in a manner that is consistent and permanently accessible. Additionally, subsets of the data should be provided in various user-friendly forms for users and programs as needed.

To achieve this, data in most common databases today is often organized into tables, which consist of rows and columns. This table model enables efficient processing and querying of data. Users can then easily access, manage, modify, update, review, and organize the data.

A commonly used tool for interacting with databases is the Structured Query Language (SQL). With SQL, data can be written and queried, facilitating the manipulation of data in databases.
