# Data Lake

## Definition
A data lake is a comprehensive and flexible data platform that allows storing and managing large amounts of structured and unstructured data in its raw form. Unlike a data warehouse, which organizes data in predefined structures, a data lake enables the storage of data in its natural format without prior transformation or aggregation.

In a data lake, data from various sources such as sensors, log files, social media, and enterprise applications can be collected. This approach allows for the integration of a wide range of data sources while providing the flexibility to analyze and structure the data later if necessary.

The term 'Data Lake' alludes to the idea of it being a large, flexible storage where a variety of data sources converge, much like in a lake. This approach facilitates access to a broad range of data for analysis and business intelligence purposes.
